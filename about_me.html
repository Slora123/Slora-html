                        <p>Hailing from Vasai, I am a passionate computer engineer with a deep interest in coding and problem-solving. 
                        I find joy in exploring the vast field of technology, constantly learning and expanding my skills. Whether it's debugging 
                        a tricky piece of code or building something new, programming excites me because of its ability to solve real-world problems.</p>
                        <p>Beyond coding, I have a creative sideâ€”I enjoy drawing and sketching, especially during those long, boring lectures 
                        (a true survival skill! ðŸ˜‚). Sports are also a big part of my life, with cricket being my favorite. I love the thrill of the game 
                        and the teamwork it fosters.</p>
                        <p>While my specific career path and domain are still open, my goal is to grow as an engineer who uses technology 
                        to make a difference. I aspire to help people by solving challenges with my skills, and I look forward to discovering where 
                        this journey takes me.</p>
